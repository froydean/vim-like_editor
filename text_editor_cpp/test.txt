1. Task
Develop a text editor in C++. Basic requirement:
- the Program must be written in C++ using STL and / or BOOST for any OS chosen by the student;
- the program should be developed using MVC design pattern;
- the program must have a UML class diagram;
- the program must have a TUI --- Text User Interface. For TUI development, you can use any open-source libraries (for example, ncurses). If the libraries are written in C, the student must develop a wrapper class to use the functionality of this C library using the Adapter pattern;
- the program should work with 1-byte text encoding;
- to work with text, the student must use their own string class in the form of a static or dynamic library. It is forbidden to modify the source code of this class. If any functionality does not meet the needs of the student, the student must implement a new class with the necessary functionality based on the existing one using the Decorator pattern;
- the application should not "hang" when working with large files (for example, reading/saving a file of 500K characters takes no longer than a second).
   
2. Theory
For the successful execution of the laboratory work it is necessary to study the following topics:
- what is a pattern;
- what they are for;
- learn the necessary patterns: MVC, adapter, decorator and etc.;
- static or dynamic library.
   
3. Basic task
3.1. Technical specification
TUI must support the cursor and status bar. The status bar should display: current operating mode, file name, line number / lines total.
The app supports 4 modes of operation:
- navigation and editing     move the cursor over the text, scroll through the pages, go to the desired line, edit the text: copy, paste, cut a line/word. When you enter command buttons, they are NOT displayed on the screen;
- text input     regular text input. Backspace, delete, insert, and all navigation actions should work;
- command input     the command input is displayed on the command line. Backspace should work on the command line
- search     as command mode, but for search.
Navigation mode     the main mode of operation, from this mode you can switch to "input Mode", "command Mode" and "search Mode". When you start the program, it starts working in this mode (see Picture 1).
